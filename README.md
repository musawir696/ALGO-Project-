String Matching Algorithm code 

Suppose you are preparing a meal for a party and you need to prepare several dishes. Each dish has a list of
ingredients. You also have a list of all the ingredients that are available. You need to check if you have enough
ingredients altogether to prepare all the dishes in any order, without using the same ingredient of one set (or of
one dish) for multiple dishes. The ingredients of one dish need to be present together, in any order, to be able
to prepare that dish.

I have write a code for preparing meal for all dishes without using same ingredient
